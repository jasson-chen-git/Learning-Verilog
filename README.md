This repo serves as a simple tracker for my Verilog/SystemVerilog progress.

Some of the earlier projects, labeled Lab## (Lab02 was not a design lab therefore not included) are school projects that were originally written in VHDL.
However, they have been redefined in Verilog/SystemVerilog with my own techniques that I learned throughout the course.
These early projects may include heavy use of comments to keep records of different coding styles or different approaches to the assignment.
They also serve as reminders and tutorials to reference later on.

Each project will aim to utilize as many of the features of Verilog/SystemVerilog to help make learning more effective.

Thanks for viewing!
